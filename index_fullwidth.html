        <p>Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>
        <p>There are a number of residential buildings designed by Robyn Boyd in Canberra, including Clark House  (Links to an external site.)and  Fenner House (Links to an external site.). Alongside these, there are a few brilliant commercial buildings, one of which will be the focus of this website. 

        This website is being developed to increase public awareness about the significance of Robin Boyd’s Churchill House (formerly Open-Systems House), in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra">Canberra</a>. In 2019, the Robin Boyd Foundation celebrated the 100th anniversary of the influential architects birth.</p>
